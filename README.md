# Winkel-eComme 🛍️


# Introduction  🙂
 Winkel is an e-Commerce shope, a *MERN Stack* app, constructed by  a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database), applied by various technologies as React.js (client-side) in the front of the app, and node.js, express 
 by using MongoDB database from the backend.
 
 
 
 ## React.js (Frontend) 👈
   The declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. 
   
 ### properties  🤓
      * Functional Components.
      * Redux (state management).
      * React-router-dom (contains DOM bindings and gives you access to React Router by default).
      * React bootstrap UI library.
      * Material-ui UI library.
      * React-JSS  (style the components by css with JS,allows to describe styles in a more descriptive).
      * Hooks (allow to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods).
      
      
      
## Express.js and Node.js & JWT  (Beckend) 👈

  * Express.js server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server. 
    Express.js bills itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed exactly what it is. 
    Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server function), and handling HTTP requests and responses. 
  * JWT (JSON Web Token) JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information, authentication system over the web.
  * Paypal sandbox integration (fake paypal for testing).
